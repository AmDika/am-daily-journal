Wanna go out on rainy days? or perhaps taking an overnight in the foothills? Backpacking through constant rain can still be quite fun if you're good at staying dry. And it's worth remembering that giant redwoods, a rainbow after the waterfall, and colorful wildflowers all made possible by the relentless pitter-patter of raindrops.

if you adopt a proper attitude, you can learn to love hiking in the rain. Proper helps. In this article, I'll give you 10 tips for taking backpacking trips through the rainy season.

**Layer with your gear in mind**  
Sometimes the long rainy weather can come thru into your clothes. So, I suggest that you should wear a full skin coverage jacket that has some water-resistant material on it. And I must say go with synthetic insulation in your jacket. For your information, if you're hiking in the milder weather you can pack a lightweight fleece or softshell jacket.

**Evaluate your rainwear**  
I think you should wear some bright color raincoat. Some psychology says it can help brighten your mood on a relentlessly gray day. Also, if you are getting some emergency while taking hiking, your jacket can help the search team to identify your position.

**Pack your rain cap  
**So, even your jacket has a brimmed hood, it does have a poor job of keeping the rain off your glasses. A rain hat should have a broad brim. If you choose a ball cap style, then you can wear it under your rain jacket.

**Evaluate your footwear  
**Waterproof shoes and boots keep your feet drier initially, making them a good option for colder weather. Renew the waterproofing at the beginning each season, or if you notice large dark spots forming when you splosh across wet terrain.
