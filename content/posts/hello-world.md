Hello there,

Well, this is my first post on my new daily journal life.

Sometimes when I got bored, I'm sitting on the bed and try to read some book. The book that I read right now is FLOW by Michael Csikszentmihalyi. That book is about discovered that people find genuine satisfaction during a state of consciousness called **FLOW**. In another way, the book in my perspective is still needed to dig deeper more than a day. Because, Psychological states that much more people need to know and how to experience when engaged in an activity that is both appropriately challenging to one's skill level, but often resulting in immersion and concentrated focus on a task.

For more detail about the book, I recommended you to buy it.
