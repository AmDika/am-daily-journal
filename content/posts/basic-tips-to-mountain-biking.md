Biking sometimes can be challenging.  If you are new for mountain biking, Here are seven beginner mountain biking tips you should know when you're first getting ready to shred.

1. Stay Loose

   Your bike role does the rollover technical terrain. And Your job to maintain the bike does its job. That's mean keeping your body loose, so it can move beneath you. Hover your butt off the saddle when riding over an obstacle like roots and rocks. When ripping down a descent, think: "push-ups arms" and "cowboy legs"
2. Maintain Momentum

   When your first riding on road it feel so comfy. But when you ride on mountain it feels counterintuitive, and while you holding on speed and even speeding up your bike the terrains will get more challenging. Remember, your bike is the one thing it needs most to keep moving forward and that is momentum. Momentum is your best friend out there, maintain it whenever you can.
3. Shift your weight

   Whenever you hit the extreme terrain, including steep inclines and declines. shift your weight forward and lean forward to keep your gravity over the rear wheel to maintain traction. When the trail tilts downward, go in the opposite direction, shifting your weight behind the saddle and over the rear wheel to avoid going over the bars.
4. Go easy on the brake

   Sometime, you'll be tempted at some point to grab both brakes. Mountain bike brakes are powerful enough that you need just one/two-finger to modulate your speed. Adjust your speed before the tricky stuff, like rock gardens and corner and then maintain your speed through them. Braking seems simple
5. Use all the gears.

   Mountain bike trail profiles tend to look like jaws opening wide for his next snack. In other words, they cover undulating terrain that shoots up and down often. Anticipate changes in the terrain by shifting before you need to. And it will keep your momentum.
6. Set your suspension

   Most mountain bikes today have at least a front suspension fork, and most have a shock absorber in the rear as well. These are a big bump nearly disappear as you roll over them. You can take a little time learning the finer nuances of setting your sag and rebound. But take a look at how to lockout and/or open your suspension, so you don't accidentally roll out on to crazy technical trail with fully rigid bike.
7. Look where you want to go.

   Staring directly at that rock you don't want to hit will nearly ensure you are going to smack right into it.
