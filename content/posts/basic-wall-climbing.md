Bouldering is a great way to build skills because you can focus solely on using your strength and balance to keep yourself on the wall.

**Top-Rope Climbing**  
This is where mostly a novice enters the world of harness-and-rope climbing. While you are climbing on this gym usually the belayer, who manages the rope to catch you in case of fall. The belayer might be a trained staff person or a friend with belay certification.
