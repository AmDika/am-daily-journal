Bikepacking is a kind of exploring nature differently. It lets you cover more mile than hiking, plus you can access dirt roads and trail that are inaccessible with another vehicle. Sometime bikepacking needs to be prepared well before you go to your destination. And If you are getting interested and started bikepacking, here some basic tips that might be useful to you.

**Bikepacking Bikes**  
Your destination of trails can be reached via mountain trails or singletrack, so a mountain bike should one of your ideal choices. But any bike can mount racks and/or storage might be useful. New handlebar bags or grips can be added to increase comfort for long days.

Some avid bikepacking enthusiasts may customize their bike for riding style or terrain, but most upgrades aim to minimize maintenance or maximize their comfort. If you are more get interested in more about choosing your right bikes, read my next post.

**Carrying options for bikepacking  
**Bikepacking carries the same gear as a backpacker but plus spare bike and tubes. Fortunately, you have more places to carry it on your bike. 

Unlike bikepacking, you don't want to carry a lot of weight. Instead, most of the weight must be placed as low as possible on your bike. Some of the typical gear setup for bikepacker beginner.

1. Daypack: Good for light, bulky items or anything sensitive to vibration.
2. Dry bag secured to a rear rack: For light to moderate lightning.
3. Handlebar bag: For light to moderate items.
4. Water bottle cages: keep the water low and centered.
5. Panniers: optional for heavy panniers.
6. Bike trailers: Optional for group/family gear or heavy items.

There are many riders become an expert at lashing gear onto the bike with tie-down straps or repurposing items to meet their needs. For example, a tent can be attached to the front of the handlebar. Nearly everyone experiments to some degree to see gear setup work best.

**Gear to bring bikepacking  
**Your bikepacking gear should include the usual backpacking items, such as sleeping bags, a tent, stove, etc. But don't forget some addition need to included, such as helmet, tube/tire-repair kit, spares tubes and multi-tool that includes a chain tool. For extended trips, add chain lube, chain pins, a spare cable, and even a light lock for in-town resupply stops.

Keep in mind, if you are added more weight on your bike, you might having some slow steady pace. I suggest, aim to save weight when possible, but without compromising safety or comfort. Lightweight gear can make riding easier and more fun.
