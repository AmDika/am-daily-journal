One of the weather predictions that you can count on sometimes can unexpectedly change. Rain or snow can fall at moderate heights, A sudden downpour may hit your ridgeline while you can still see sunlight beaming on a distant peak. Fog and clouds can cling to coastline even though the sun is shining full-force just a half-mile inland.

Unpredictable weather is an inherent risk in wilderness travel. But you need to always come prepared. It's may impossible for certain what the weather will do, even on day hikes. Think ahead for a little common sense and a cautious attitude are two of the most important items you can bring with you into the backcountry.

**Hope for the best, prepare for the worst**. carry reliable and assorted layers of clothing, that you can wear according to the needs of the moment.

**Investigate a region's historical weather** pattern before you go. If you want to plan to hike in such a summer wilderness place. I suggest you talk to ranger stations and ask about the local guidelines.

**Stay informed during your trip.** You could bring a tiny radio AM from ranger stations or if there is a free map on the local regions you should bring that, too. Always ask for local forecasts, it needed to prepare well your trip.

Pay attention to developments in the sky. The shapes and movements of clouds typically foreshadow changes in the weather. You don't have to have a year's experience in the outdoors to be able to spot some of the common cloud formations that typically signal changing weather.

Imagine this; You're hiking along a ridge with blue sky all around you. But, when you look at a peak in the distance, you see an oval-shaped hovering above the summit. Some people said this cloud formation, known as "lenticular cloud", Look like a UFO. Often, you'll see multiple lens-shaped formations that appear to stack on top of each other creating a ripple. These clouds are a sure sign that wind is picking up in the distance.

If you are headed toward the summit with this type of cloud over it, foul weather could be anywhere from 6 to 18 hours away. This gives you plenty of time to throw on your fleece, men's or women's rain jacket, or any other wind and rain gear you may need.

For your info, these are kinds of types of cloud that might be to know.

**Warm Fronts**  
Type of defined as warm air masses that gradually push out and replace cooler bodies of air. Warm fronts, which move at roughly half the speed of cold fronts, rarely produce violent weather,  but the precipitation they generate may linger for long periods. There is some type of warm front progress from thin, high-level cirrus cloud to low or dense stratus cloud:

**Cirrus cloud  
**These thin, streaky or wispy clouds sometimes resemble brush stroke on a blue canvas high in the sky.

**Cirrocumulus cloud**  
Arrive next, often appearing as small puff or rippled row, followed with cirrostratus cloud. Which tend to fill with ice crystal frequently wallpapering large area of blue sky with thin. a bright sheet of clouds.

**Altostratus**  
Some kind of smoky looking mid-level and nimbostratus cloud(gray, thick, low-level) come next and usually carry the precipitation, anything from a drizzle to steady rain or snow.

**Cold Fronts**  
Involves cold air masses that wedges under warm air pockets. Cloud fronts can develop rapidly and move swiftly, causing the temperature to drop. Wind directions to shift and barometric pressure to fall.

**Cumulus Cloud**  
They are white puffy, fair-weather clouds. Should these puff continue to build upward, though, rain may come late in the day.

**Cumulonimbus Cloud**  
Rise vertically and expand dramatically from their original white, puffy bases to soar high into the upper atmosphere. On the other occasions, their tops will flatten out into menacing, anvil-like shape. These classic "thunderhead" clouds foretell potentially severe weather. They are also formed independent of cold fronts, blossoming in the afternoon hours of very warm days.

**Tip:** if late-day storms become a pattern during your trip, rise early each and cover as much ground as you can during the days more stable hours.

**Barometric Pressure**  
You may have probably heard your local meteorologist talk about barometric pressure, and it's actually easier to understand than you may think. Try throwing an altimeter into your hiking gear. 

If you want to know about altimeter, It's about an instrument used to  measure the altitude of an object above a fixed level

**Lastly, Don't Forget to Prep  
**Even if you enter the wilderness with extensive knowledge of clouds, storms and cold fronts. And if you don't take an actual hiking gear then the knowledge will just go to waste.  
  
It's always best to check the official weather forecast before you go, but knowing what the change looks like can be a great skill on any hiking trip.
